        Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former
        international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is
        regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket and
        popularly known as God of Cricket by his fans. He was a right-handed
        top-order bastmen in the Indian Cricket Team. He is known for his
        batting skills, technique, vision and game reading.[4] He is the all
        time most runscorer in both ODI and Test Format with more than 18000
        runs and 15000 runs respectively in total. He also holds the record for
        receiving most Man-of-the-match awards in International Cricket with all
        forms combined. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his
        Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the
        age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India
        internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through
        his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all
        time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all
        time, behind Viv Richards. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of
        the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in
        six World Cup appearances for India. He had previously been named
        "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament.
